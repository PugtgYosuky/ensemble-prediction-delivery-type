## Data availability

The data are not made publicly available for reasons of privacy, use in the development of other manuscripts and ethical restrictions. Nevertheless, the data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

## Repository organization

The *src* directory contains the code to run the classifiers, divided by the type of classifier (tabular or image). Inside each directory, there is a *README.md* file with more details about each classifier.

The *data* directory should contain the data (tabular and ECO images) to test the classifiers. Due to privacy reasons, the data was not made available, but a description of the directory structure is detailed in each classifiers' source directory.
