# Prediction of vaginal delivery after labour induction

The present repository is related with two works for the prediction of vaginal delivery or cesarean section. The first work *Predicting vaginal delivery after labor induction using machine learning: development of a multivariable prediction model* uses tabular data from past patients to train a machine learning system. The second work, *Ensemble learning for fetal ultrasound and maternal-fetal data to predict mode of delivery after labor induction*, creates an ensemble as uses two sources of data: the previous tabular dataset with patients history, and images from ultrasounds.
